# cp03-template
This repository is a template for computational project 3 in NPRE 247. 

## Resources
To submit your project, you'll need to learn about git and github. 
It's not as intimidating as it seems, and your CAs can help you in the computer lab.
Also, Prof. Huff can help you by appointment.

To help you figure git out on your own, here are some resources:
- [Prof. Huff video](https://mediaspace.illinois.edu/media/t/0_a7qttbek/34851501)
- [Git & GitHub Cheatsheet](https://education.github.com/git-cheat-sheet-education.pdf)
- [Yes You Can Git](https://speakerdeck.com/willingc/yes-you-can-git)

## Setup Instructions

0. Visit the assignment url and claim your id.
1. Download your assignment repository. (Use `git clone`.)
2. Delete the report template you aren't planning to use. (Use `git rm`.)
3. Commit this change (Use `git commit`.) 
4. Sync this change to your fork (Use `git push`.)

## Report Directory
There is a 'report' directory. 
- It contains 2 document templates (one .docx and one .tex file) for your convenience. The tex file has an associated .bib file to hold references. You can learn about .bib (bibtex) files online.
- You can start with the word doc or the LaTeX document and edit from there. 
- If you prefer some other format (e.g. markdown), feel free to use it as long as a .pdf can be created with that format (e.g. via pandoc).
- The report directory must include at least a pdf file.

## Code Directory
- There is a 'code' directory. It contains the input template for serpent. 
- You should place all of your code in this directory.  
- Don't forget to `git add`  `git commit` and `git push` all of the files you want to include.

## Output Directory
- There is an 'output' directory. It contains nothing. 
- This is where you can optionally place the output files and plots generated by your code.
- Don't forget to `git add`  `git commit` and `git push` all of the files you want to include.

## Submission
There is no submit button. All files that have been added, committed, and 
pushed to the online repository before the deadline will be part of your 
assignment submission.
